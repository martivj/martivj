<h2 id="about">🧑‍💻 About Me</h2>

Hello! I am a 26 year old fullstack software developer from Norway, with a background in science as a Physics MSc. 
I love learning about new technologies, and I actively pursue projects in both the web development world as well as mobile apps. 

As a fullstack developer I have experience with all kinds of front- and backend technologies, including DevOps facing work and integrations with cloud platforms like AWS.
During my Master's education in physics I specialized in problem solving with Python, running numerical simulations for reasearch on materials with quantum chemistry techniques.

My go-to languages are TypeScript for web development, Flutter for app development, Java for backend APIs, and Python for anything scripting, machine learning or numerical simulations.
I recently became inspired to try more embedded programming on IoT devices with C, and learn C# for .NET backend development.

**Work**

I am currently working as the lead developer for Go Arctic Tern LLC, a US-based company focused on helping immigrants within the country. 
We recently launched the [MyGreatTimeline](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arctictern.mygreattimeline) app project on Android, with an iOS version soon to follow!

**University**

In addition to my consultant job I am currently finishing a bachelor's degree in informatics at NTNU in Trondheim, Norway. 
The final project tackles embedded programming on IoT devices powered by [Nordic Semiconductor](https://www.nordicsemi.com/) chips, where we are writing C code to communicate over MQTT to a .NET based backend. 
Compared to my previous experience, this project is much closer to hardware, which makes for a great learning experience to become more well rounded as a developer!

**Side projects**

As a side project I am developing a desktop-based learning resource sharing platform for lecturers in adult education, in affiliation with a team at [SLI Senja](https://sli-senja.no/). 
The MVP was completed in January this year, and after some improvements I am planning to open source the code of the project as a customizable template. 

Another noteworthy side project has been the Temporas desktop/mobile app, a time tracking tool for productivity that I myself have been using every day since our MVP of autumn 2024. 
We are a team of 3 developers, building with Flutter and AWS Amplify, planning to get the product out on app stores some time in 2025.

<h2 id="projects">🔭 Current Projects Overview</h2>

### Public

- 📊 [**HoursReportGenerator**](https://github.com/martivj/HoursReportGenerator) (web app): Data processing tool for generating formatted Excel reports from time tracking CSV files. Building with Python and openpyxl in the Flask framework, currently hosting on Render.
- 🏷️ [**BadgeGenerator**](https://github.com/martivj/BadgeGenerator): Simple CLI tool for generating markdown friendly badges with [shields.io](https://shields.io/) (used for this profile page). Building with Python.

### Private

- 📄 **MyGreatTimeline** (mobile app): A document storage solution to help immigrants in the US show proof of presence. Building with Flutter to distribute bundles for both Android and iOS.
- 📳 **Bachelor's project** (mobile/embedded): IoT devices project for battery sensor monitoring on a boat, working in affiliation with [Bouvet](https://www.bouvet.no/). Involves embedded C programming and integrations with a .NET backend over MQTT, and visualization in a Next.js frontend.
- 💡 **IdéBankSLI** (desktop app): Learning resource sharing platform for lecturers in adult education, in affiliation with a team at [SLI Senja](https://sli-senja.no/). Building with TypeScript (React + Vite) and a Tauri bundler, Convex for the backend.
- ⌛ **Temporas** (desktop/mobile): Productivity app for tracking your time. Building with Flutter and AWS Amplify (Cognito, AppSync, DynamoDB). Currently in the pre-release phase, working towards a launch on Android/iOS app stores.
